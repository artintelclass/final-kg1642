I have had two ideas.

First one is an webapp which can identify which celebrity has similar tweets as the user. For this, the user needs to give us permission to use their tweets.
First we will collect tweets of some famous celebrities. Around 50 celebrities should be enough. To find the celebrity which has the similar tweets as the user, I will use the algorithm designed by Iwao FUJINO and Yuko HOSHINO. The algorithm can be found in their paper [here.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7c6/0df10f8952d12f0db3a0245d37ee70c9834b.pdf?_ga=2.134033166.1240886954.1523799469-1744111956.1523799469)

Second one is to create an webapp that lets users take a photo via webcamp and determines whether they look like more of a dog or a cat. In order to
train my model I will be using 25000 cat and dog images that can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
